Things that were not accomlished:
	cannot handle anything but regular text files
	cannot handle files greater than MAXBUF of 8192
	list will not show if file is incomplete
	realiability exists, but did not have time to actually implement on client side
	GET will assemble the file based off of one config
	1 second timeout on client does not exist, if wanted on server uncomment setsockopt options

Notes:
Username and password are read by user input instead of via file
Sending an empty file with GET will cause all servers to seg fault
Use a different hashing than md5
Hash filename instead of file

Server programs:
	To build:
		cd to inside the dfs# directory and type make
	To run:
		./dfs_server <port>

Client program:
	To build:
		cd to client directory and type make
	To run:
		./dfs_client dfc.conf

The dfc.conf uses port numbers 10001-10004
Username and password are still in file but not used
There is a test file provided called fast, it shouldn't be in any user's directory so it can be used to verify GET if desired
